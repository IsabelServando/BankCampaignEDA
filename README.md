# BankCampaignEDA
My first ever EDA: determine factors influencing customer subscription to a bank term deposit.
Sharing this because even though I just used Excel, I was excited to see how even a simple tool could have the power to reveal interesting data stories, especially since I was curious enough to find them. I was really excited to uncover what was hidden in the data!

Tasks:
Using the bank.csv file, perform the following:
• Import data into Excel and preform data cleaning. Describe the changes you made and your observation.
• Perform filtering using table format. Group and summarize data – be creative. Describe your observation.
• Use color scale or data bar to explore and highlight the data. Describe your observation.
• Build a Pivot table to show relationship of column Y vs other factors (columns). Describe your observation, what was the hypotheses observed?
