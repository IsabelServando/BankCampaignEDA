# BankCampaignEDA
My first ever EDA: determine factors that makes a customer say YES or NO to a bank term deposit subscription.
Sharing this because even though I just used Excel, I was excited to see how even a simple tool could have the power to reveal interesting data stories, especially since I was curious enough to find them. I was really excited to uncover what was hidden in the data!

Interesting findings (details, along with the tasks to achieve these, are in the PDF)
• While majority of the customers have a positive ave yrly balance, those who say no to the term deposit subscription have a lower average than those of the yes.
• Those without a Housing Loan were/are more likely to say YES to the Term Deposit Subscription.
• The average duration of last contact (in seconds) that got a YES is 2x the average duration of last contact that got a NO. The longer the contact, the more likely it will get a YES.
• The optimal number of times to contact the customer to get a YES is 1-3 or 1-4 times at most. Contacting the customer more often than that may just be a waste of time and money.
• The majority of customers who said YES to the current campaign were also a "Success" in the previous campaign. To optimize efforts,  the next campaign could focus on those for whom the previous campaign/s was/were a "Success."
• The higher the average yearly balance of a customer, the more likely he will subscribe to a Term Deposit.
• While majority of those who said YES to the Term Deposit Subscription have no Credit Default, the majority who said NO also have no Credit Default. Therefore, Credit Default has potentially no relationship with the Outcome of the Current Campaign.
